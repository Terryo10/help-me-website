# Stripe Gateway Setup

This document explains how to set up and use the Stripe gateway in your Laravel application.

## Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
```

For production, use live keys that start with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`.

## Stripe Account Setup

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Create a new account or log in to existing account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Copy the Publishable Key and Secret Key
5. Add them to your `.env` file

## Database Migration

Run the migration to add the required fields:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

### Creating a Stripe Payment

```php
// Route to Stripe gateway
Route::get('/payment/stripe/{orderId}', \App\Livewire\Gateways\StripeGateway::class);
```

### Stripe Gateway Features

The Stripe gateway provides:

1. **Direct Card Processing**: Processes credit/debit cards directly
2. **Real-time Validation**: Validates card details before submission
3. **3D Secure Support**: Handles Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)
4. **Webhook Handling**: Automatically processes Stripe notifications
5. **Transaction Tracking**: Full transaction history and status updates

### Webhook Setup

1. In your Stripe Dashboard, go to Webhooks
2. Add webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/stripe/webhook`
3. Subscribe to these events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.requires_action`
   - `payment_intent.canceled`
   - `charge.succeeded`
   - `charge.failed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret and add to your `.env` file

### Supported Card Types

- Visa
- Mastercard
- American Express
- Discover
- Diners Club
- JCB
- UnionPay

### Transaction Statuses

- `pending`: Transaction created but not yet processed
- `processing`: Payment requires additional authentication (3D Secure)
- `completed`: Payment successfully completed
- `failed`: Payment failed or was declined
- `cancelled`: Payment was cancelled

### Card Validation

The gateway validates:
- Card number format and length
- Expiry date (month/year)
- CVC code (3-4 digits)
- Cardholder name

### Error Handling

The gateway handles common errors:
- Invalid card details
- Insufficient funds
- Card declined
- Network connectivity issues
- Stripe API errors

All errors are logged and user-friendly messages are displayed.

### Security Features

- PCI DSS compliance through Stripe
- Secure card data handling
- 3D Secure authentication
- Webhook signature verification
- CSRF protection on all forms

## Testing

### Test Card Numbers

Stripe provides test card numbers for different scenarios:

**Successful Payments:**
- `4242424242424242` - Visa
- `5555555555554444` - Mastercard
- `378282246310005` - American Express

**Failed Payments:**
- `4000000000000002` - Card declined
- `4000000000009995` - Insufficient funds
- `4000000000000069` - Card expired

**3D Secure Testing:**
- `4000002500003155` - Requires authentication
- `4000002760003184` - Authentication fails

Use any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVC for testing.
